# **Overview**

We present below early results of our analysis for CalPERS state members of PERF A. 


## Types of members
There are five types of state members in PERF A and currently we categorize and model them as two groups based on the similarity of benefit policies and member characteristics:

- **Group 1**: State miscellaneous and state industrial members. 
- **Group 2**: State safety members, state peace officers/firefighters (POFF), and California Highway Patrol (CHP)

(TODO: We are going to distinguish classic and PEPRA members in each group in the next iteration)

See appendix for a diagram that summarizes the types of state members of PERF A. 


## Policy scenarios
We have modeled each group under current policy and under three types of alternative policies, each with several variants differing in the degree that benefits are affected:

1. Benefit factor reduction: For all future years of service for all active employees, an x% reduction in the “benefit factor.” (The benefit factor is multiplied by a plan member’s final salary and years of service to determine the initial retirement benefit.) This is far more aggressive than the policies that have been tested in “California Rule” litigation, which have
focused on much narrower scaling back of future benefits (e.g., disallowing “air time”). Variants:
  
    - 50% reduction to benefit factor.
    - 25% reduction to benefit factor.
    - (Example: If the original benefit factor is 3%, it will become 2.25% after a 25% reduction )

2. COLA suspension: The COLA/escalator is suspended or reduced until the plan's funded ratio reaches a certain level. Variants:

    - COLA is fully suspended until the plan is fully funded under the plan chosen actuarial discount rate (7%).
    - COLA is reduced from 2% to 1% per year until the plan is fully funded under the plan chosen actuarial discount rate (7%).
    - (TODO) COLA is reduced from 2% to 1% per year until the plan is fully funded under a more conservative discount rate (5%). (Similar to the Rhode Island plan) 
    

3. Both policies combined: The benefit factor is reduced and the COLA is
suspended/reduced. Variants:

    - 50% benefit factor reduction + full COLA suspension until full funding (7% discount rate)
    - 25% benefit factor reduction + COLA reduced to half (1%) until full funding (7% discount rate)  

We assume all policies go fully into effect in the first year. The benefit factor reduction affects future
service of current workers and all service of new hires. The COLA suspension affects all current retirees,
all current workers, and all new hires.


The policies with greater benefit reductions help define bounds, and the policies with lesser benefit reductions are closer to what might be practical for policymakers. 

Additional variants that we may explore in the future: (1) providing lesser reductions for older retirees or workers who are close to retirement, (2) apply only to new hires. These variants would provide lower fiscal savings and greater protection to plan
members.

## Assumptions on how CA governments would respond 
We examined these policies under two assumptions about how California governments would respond:

1. Assumption A: Take the savings now, in lower contributions: All policies reduce actuarial
liability, unfunded liability, and normal cost. Lower normal cost and amortization cost reduce
the actuarially determined contribution (ADC). Under this assumption employers pay just the ADC,
which would be lower than what they pay now.

2. Assumption B: Maintain employer contributions despite the ADC reduction: Even though the ADC is
lower, employers pay the ADC plus an additional contribution to keep their payments near
where they were before, reducing unfunded liability more quickly than otherwise. However, this
can interact with the contingent COLA: if full funding is reached sooner, then benefit payments
will go up as the COLA is put back into effect.


## Investment return scearnios
In the tables below we show results for 2018 (the actuarial valuation year and our first year) and for
2028. The model goes out much further in time and it can be useful to pay attention to later time
periods as well to gain a better understanding of investment risks and amortization policies.
We have examined these policies and variants under three investment scenarios:

1. Deterministic: 7% investment return assumption achieved every year. This is the CalPERS
assumption, save for any planned earnings assumption reductions.

2. Deterministic asset shock: This is based loosely on stress-test scenarios used by Pew, which in
turn are based loosely on Dodd-Frank assumptions. We assume 7% return in 2018, 2% in 2019,
negative 24% in 2020, then 3 years of 12% (2021-2023), then 7% annually thereafter.

3. Stochastic: 7% expected mean return, 12% standard deviation: This allows us to see how the
policies, particularly the contingent COLA policy, interact with investment return volatility.
The tables below provide summary results for the deterministic scenarios. We will add tables for the
stochastic return scenario in a later iteration.
